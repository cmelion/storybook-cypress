## Development

Forms are build using [react-jsonschema-form](https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - 
A simple React component capable of building HTML forms out of a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/).

API calls are mocked via [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) i.e.
[User Walls API Response Generator Post Schema](http://localhost:3030/userWallsAPIResponseGeneratorPostSchema )
